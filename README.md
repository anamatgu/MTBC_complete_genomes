# Analysis of MTBC complete genomes
This repository has been created to describe and reproduce the steps followed for analysing a dataset composed of 216 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) complete genomes. The repository contains different directories with specific analyses and customized scripts that follow this order:

1. Filtering and quality control of long reads
2. _De novo_ assembly, polishing, and lift-over
4. Multiple Genome Alignment: construction, refinement, and variant calling


## Data availability

The MTBC long-read sequences and assemblies analyzed in this study have been deposited on the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) project PRJEB89421. An inferred MTBC most likely common ancestor (MTBCA) was used as the reference genome, and it can be found on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3497110
