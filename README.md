# Analysis of MTBC complete genomes
This repository has been created to describe the steps followed in this study: 'XXXX', to analyse Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex complete (MTBC) genomes, including some customized scripts. The repository contains different directories with specific analyses that follow this order:

1. Filtering and quality control of long reads
2. _De novo_ assembly, polishing, and lift-over
4. Multiple Genome Alignment: construction, refinement, and variant calling

The MTBC long-read sequences and assemblies analyzed in this study have been deposited on the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) in the project PRJEB89421. The MTBC most likely common ancestor (MTBCA) used as a reference genome can be found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3497110
